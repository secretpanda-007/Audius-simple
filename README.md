# Audius Simple App

This is a simple web app that uses the Audius API to display monthly trending songs, allow users to search for songs, and play tracks directly.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to use the app.
2. The app uses `https://discoveryprovider2.audius.co` as the hardcoded API host.

## Note

- Ensure you have internet access for API requests.
- Check your browser's console (F12) for errors if tracks donâ€™t display.
- The `app_name` is set to "SimpleAudiusApp" in `app.js`. Replace it with your own for production if needed.

## Deployment

Deploy directly to Vercel by connecting your GitHub repository. Vercel will serve `index.html` as the main page.
